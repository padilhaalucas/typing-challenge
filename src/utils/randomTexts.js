  `Because of the laboriousness, since the
  1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate
  translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently,
  the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation
  services and has facilitated "language localization". Ideally, the translator
  must know both languages, as well as the subject that is to be translated.`,

  `A paralegal is a person trained in legal matters who performs tasks requiring
  knowledge of the law and legal procedures. A paralegal is not a lawyer but can
  be employed by a law office or work freelance at a company or law office.
  Paralegals are not allowed to offer legal services directly to the public on
  their own and must perform their legal work under an attorney or law firm.`,

  `A teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of
  the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls,
  help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for
  extracurricular activities. In some education systems, teachers may have
  responsibility for student discipline.`,

  `Hunt and peck, also known as Eagle Finger, is a common
  form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually.
  Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been
  typed without glancing away from the keys. Although good accuracy may be achieved,
  any typing errors that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not
  looking at the screen.`,

  `Words per minute (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in recruitment.
  For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or
  keystrokes. Therefore, "brown" counts as one word, but "accounted" counts as two.
  The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables
  comparison across language and hardware boundaries.`
