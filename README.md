# Typing Challenge

This is a simple app for users to test and improve their typing skills. The app will present the user with a random text paragraph or the user can c/p his own choice of the paragraph. We will call it a challenge. Then the user will select the time duration of the test it can be 1 m, 2m 5m, or custom. Once the test is set up he can start the test and hence the timer.
The user needs to type the paragraph in another text box as it is. For each correct word, he will get 1 point for each incorrect word he types he will receive 0 points. Total points will be the total no of words in the paragraph.
At the end of the test, the user will be presented with his score which is his typing accuracy and speed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
